## Setting up the build

Dependencies:
* `g++ 7.5+` or `clang++ 3.8+`
* `CMake 3.16+`

The test suite uses [Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) v2.13 but it is already included in the `lib` directory.

After cloning this repository (or uncompressing a [release](https://github.com/xboard/mcts_zuniq/release)), go to the source code diretory and write:
```shell
mkdir -p build
cd build/
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-DQUIET_MODE=1" ..
make
```

To suggest a specific compiler you can write:

```shell
CXX=clang++ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-DQUIET_MODE=1" ..
```

To test your build execute:

```shell
ctest
```

in directory `build/`
